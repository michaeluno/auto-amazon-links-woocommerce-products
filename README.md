# Auto Amazon Links - WooCommerce Products
Integrates WooCommerce with Auto Amazon Links

This WordPress plugin converts Auto Amazon Links units to WooCommerce products.

## Basic Behaviors

- When the **Renew Cache** action link in the unit listing table is clicked, the plugin attempts to update products. 

## Usage
1. Have units created with Auto Amazon Links.
2. Navigate to **Dashboard** -> **Auto Amazon Links** -> **Manage Units** and click on **Edit** of the unit you want to convert to WooCommerce products.
3. Find the **Unit to WooCommerce Product Converter** section and enable the option.
4. Go back to the unit listing table (Step 2) and click **Renew Cache** in the row of the subject unit.
